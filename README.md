Hey everybody!

Here is my Lowboi mkII worm extruder design. This extruder is designed to use the internal parts of the Cannon extruder sold by Mellow 3D Store on Aliexpress, and a few extra parts.

It uses a 19.5:1 reduction worm drive to drive large gears and hobs. This extruder can push a lot of filament and produces a nice smooth extrusion.

The gear/hob assembly is supported on custom length shafts with F3-8M thrust washers either side, held in place with a gentle preload by the Thrust Mount Caps. Using a washer or a spring washer is recommended, but not strictly necessary.

Parts you will need:

Cannon extruder gear kit including stepper motor - 1

2.98-3mm steel roundbar for shafts
  - 23.5mm long - 2 off
  - 20mm long - 1 off

F3-8M thrust washers - 4 off

M3 x 4mm x 4mm Brass melt inserts - 8 off

M3 x 8mm Capscrews - 10 off

I will update with exploded assembly pics at some point
